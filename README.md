# Calculus Helper Alexa Skill [![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-2.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) [![Alexa Skill](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon-Published-orange.svg)](http://amzn.to/2AjyGqv)

This is the code of my Amazon Alexa Skill [Calculus Helper](http://amzn.to/2AjyGqv)

## How it works

This is a Python program that interacts with the Amazon Alexa SDK and references a database filled with this years Calculus terms, definitions, and examples.

## Why

After my Calculus teacher found out I was interested in programming he suggested that my unit and final assessments could be done in the form of an app. I took this suggestion and made an skill (app) for Amazon Alexa. My app has a list of Calculus terms, definitions, and examples. You can ask Alexa what a term is, you can also ask for only definitions or only examples.
